## Overview
Many Bicycle Sharing Program are running around the world. Bicycle Sharing System are a means of renting bicycle Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. And these system is automated via a network of joint location throught the city.

So we have a historical Data of these bicycle sharing system. Based on this data we are going to findout the pattern and build the model to forcast bicycle sharing demand.

**Note:** I have build two spark application one for **model generation** and another for **model demand prediction**.
